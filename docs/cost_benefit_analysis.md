# Cost-Benefit Analysis for LLM Fine-Tuning

## Cloud Provider Comparison

| Provider | Free Tier GPU | Storage | Network | Duration |
|----------|---------------|---------|---------|----------|
| AWS | No free GPU. T4 costs ~$0.35/hr | S3: 5GB free, then $0.023/GB | 1GB free, then $0.09/GB | 12 months |
| Google Cloud | $300 credit usable for T4 GPUs | GCS: 5GB free, then $0.020/GB | 1GB free, then $0.08/GB | 90 days |
| Azure | $200 credit usable for GPUs | Blob: 5GB free, then $0.018/GB | 5GB free, then $0.087/GB | 12 months |

## Training Resource Requirements

- **Model Size**: 3.5 GB (BLOOM-1b7)
- **Dataset Size**: 0.5 GB (IMDB with augmentation)
- **Training Duration**: 6 hours (3 epochs × 2 hours)
- **Minimum GPU**: NVIDIA T4 (16GB VRAM)

## Estimated Costs

- **AWS**: $2.10 (T4 GPU @ $0.35/hr × 6 hours)
- **Google Cloud**: $2.70 (T4 GPU @ $0.45/hr × 6 hours)
- **Azure**: $2.40 (NC-series GPU @ $0.40/hr × 6 hours)

## Performance Benefits

- **Accuracy Improvement**: Expected 5-10% increase over base model
- **Business Value**: Enhanced sentiment analysis capabilities for customer feedback processing
- **ROI Estimation**: For processing 10,000 reviews monthly, expected 20% reduction in manual review time

## Multi-Cloud Strategy Benefits

By utilizing all three providers' free tiers, we can distribute workloads optimally:
- **AWS**: Primary data storage and model hosting
- **Google Cloud**: GPU-intensive training (utilizing $300 credit)
- **Azure**: Testing and evaluation (utilizing $200 credit)
