# Phase 2: LLM Fine-Tuning Framework Setup & Distributed Training

## Memory Constraints & Mitigation Strategies
During implementation, we encountered GPU memory limitations using Google Colab's T4 GPU (16GB VRAM) with the BLOOM-1b7 model (1.7 billion parameters). While the full training couldn't be completed due to these constraints, we've documented the proper configuration and optimization techniques that would be used in a production environment.

## Dataset Statistics
- **Dataset**: IMDB Movie Reviews (50,000 reviews)
- **Training samples**: 27,500 (including 5,000 augmented examples)
- **Validation samples**: 2,500
- **Test samples**: 25,000

## Distributed Training Configuration
- **Framework**: DeepSpeed with ZeRO Stage 2
- **Hardware Target**: Multi-GPU setup (8× NVIDIA T4 or 4× V100)
- **Memory Optimization Techniques**:
  - Gradient accumulation (16 steps)
  - Mixed precision training (FP16)
  - Gradient checkpointing
  - ZeRO optimizer state partitioning
  - Sequence length reduction (256 tokens)

## Implementation Components
1. **Environment Setup**: PyTorch + Transformers + DeepSpeed
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Successfully completed with synonym augmentation
3. **Distributed Training**: Configured but limited by available hardware
4. **Evaluation Framework**: Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall metrics

## Hardware Requirements Analysis
For full training of BLOOM-1b7, we recommend:
- Minimum: 4× NVIDIA T4 GPUs (16GB each)
- Optimal: 2× NVIDIA A100 GPUs (40GB each)
- Cloud alternative: AWS p3.8xlarge or equivalent

## Next Steps
The proper configuration is in place to continue with Phase 3 once more capable hardware is available, or alternatively, to explore model quantization or distillation approaches.
