# Phase 1: Initial Design & Infeasibility Assessment

## Completed Tasks

### 1.1 LLM Fine-Tuning Requirements
- ✅ Selected BLOOM-1b7 as our target LLM for sentiment analysis
- ✅ Chosen IMDB Movie Reviews dataset for fine-tuning
- ✅ Performed detailed cost-benefit analysis across cloud providers
- ✅ Implemented data augmentation with synonym replacement and random word operations

### 1.2 Infrastructure & Cloud Planning
- ✅ Designed multi-cloud infrastructure utilizing AWS, GCP, and Azure free tiers
- ✅ Selected appropriate GPU instances (T4) for training
- ✅ Configured distributed training with DeepSpeed
- ✅ Set up Kubernetes for auto-scaling and resource management

## Key Decisions

- **Model**: BLOOM-1b7 (1.7B parameters) for balance between performance and resource requirements
- **Dataset**: IMDB (50,000 reviews) with augmentation for sentiment analysis
- **Training Infrastructure**: GCP T4 GPUs utilizing free tier credits
- **Distributed Training**: DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 1 with FP16 mixed precision
- **Resource Management**: Kubernetes with HPA for auto-scaling

## Next Steps
Moving to Phase 2, we will implement the actual fine-tuning framework, set up the training environment, and begin distributed training across our multi-cloud infrastructure.
